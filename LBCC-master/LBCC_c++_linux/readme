1.Experimental environment:
Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS
Linux version 4.2.0-27-generic
gcc version 4.8.2


2.
complex.txt: the information of protein complexes.
deg.txt: the essential proteins.
input.txt: the input file(PPI networks), format(proteinname	proteinname	).
output.txt: the output file. 


3.Usage
Running LBCC from command line:

(1) g++ centrality-cpu.cpp fheap.cpp graph.cpp -o out
(2) ./out

If you want to change the input data, please copy the contents of PPI networks into the file "input.txt".

4.Steps to reproduce the analysis

(1) ranking proteins in descending order based on their LBCC values 
(2) selecting the top 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 proteins as candidate essential proteins
(3) the number of true essential proteins is determined according to attribute ESS in file "output.txt"
